APP REQUIRES A JSON CAPABLE MYSQL SERVER. XAMPP DEFAULT DOES NOT WORK.

Assumes that a single user can have as many extracurr, skills, work exp as necessary, as well as leaving open the option to search by these fields
Birthday is used to compute age, age is not to be stored to save space
Addresses are separated per field to force data integrity (from experience at Barangka)
Data validation is done in the front end
Sex and track are stored as integers with set correspondence (i.e. 1 male, 0 female; 0 - GAS, 1-Stem, 2-ICT etc.) to save space
Honors is stored as a json, as it is not valuable to categorize users by this field vs. skills, work experience and extracurr
K12 student and graduates are on the same table, separated by an attribute called isGraduate to make searches less expensive (1 table vs 2 tables)
English and Filipino skills are assumed per user, but other languages are not and are placed in a separate table to reduce db size (2 int colums vs 2 additional entries (english, filipino) on a language table)
STRING is VARCHAR(255) by default in Sequelize
Hashing is done on the server side to reduce transfer volumes
Honors can be formatted as needed depending on formatting
